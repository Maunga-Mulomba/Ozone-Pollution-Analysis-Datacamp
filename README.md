# üß† Ozone Pollution Analysis ‚Äî DataCamp Competition Project

## üìò Overview
This project was completed as part of a **DataCamp competition**.  
All data, problem statements, and evaluation criteria were provided by **[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)**.  

The goal of this analysis is to explore and evaluate ozone pollution across various regions in California using real-world data from the **U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)**.  
The project focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and uncovering insights related to air quality trends, high-risk regions, and possible policy implications.

## üåç Background
You are a data analyst at an environmental company. Your task is to evaluate ozone pollution across different regions in California.  
The dataset obtained from the **EPA** contains daily ozone measurements at monitoring stations, but it includes real-world challenges such as missing values, inconsistent formats, duplicates, and outliers.  

Before meaningful insights can be drawn, the dataset must be cleaned and validated. Once prepared, the analysis should identify temporal and spatial patterns, high ozone concentration zones, and any relationships between ozone levels and urban activity (e.g., weekday vs. weekend differences).

## üéØ Project Objectives / Challenge
Create a report that covers the following aspects:

1. **EDA and Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.  
   - Explore data distributions and detect outliers.  

2. **Trend Analysis**
   - Evaluate how daily maximum 8-hour ozone concentrations vary across time and regions.  

3. **Regional Insights**
   - Identify regions consistently reporting high ozone concentrations.  
   - Compare ozone levels from different measurement methods.  

4. **Urban Activity Effect**
   - Assess whether weekday vs. weekend patterns influence ozone levels.  

5. **(Bonus)**
   - Create a **geospatial heatmap** showing high ozone concentration areas across California.
